My first session was in Cherry Hill, NJ on my second day at the company. We worked with developers, product owners, and the department manager to map out key workflows and operational pain points.

Iterations often integrated work objects across screens to isolate responsibilities. But over time, feedback showed users needed to see and act on everything within a single, unified view. This led to more contextual changes in how we organized interfaces, moving toward consolidated screens where related context and actions.'

We\'d team align on what the problem was and how it affected user workflows. From there, we often ran "crazy eights" sketching exercises to quickly generate ideas and test concepts on paper. It was an effective way to exhaust assumptions early and invite visual thinking before we touched tools like Figma or Miro.'

These weren\'t always linear. Logistics workflows are notoriously messy, so we aimed to prototype features, like a core idea at first iteration. In many cases, a single screen could have seemed simple at first blush, but ended up requiring business rules, workflows, and backend constraints, requiring multiple iterations to account for business rules, workflows, and backend constraints.'

Product managers were our primary channel to user feedback, but we also received feedback directly from users and engineering leads. Regular design reviews allowed teammates to ask questions and point out missing use cases. Often, the act of visualizing a flow exposed things we hadn\'t accounted for.'

        description: 'Our design system evolved alongside the product. Early on, it was a fast-moving collection of styles and atomic patterns. As we scaled and reused patterns across more stable set of components, I often iterated components directly in LiveView â€” meaning we worked out the components. I often iterated components directly in LiveView â€” meaning we tested components, many of which were tested across the platform to ensure consistency but depending on the context, some patterns moved straight from paper sketches to code. We eventually laid out documentation and organized components alongside reusable functions and reduce implementation time.'

My involvement depended on the complexity of the feature. Being part of the build process gave me insight into how backend logic and data structures influenced design, which helped prevent unrealistic handoffs. When needed, we discussed constraints or alternatives together, which, looking back, made the process feel less like handing off a design and more like co-creating it together.'
