    scope: 'Designed and built a web app where people log tastings, learn vocabulary, and memorialize wine experiences. Includes an admin surface for structured wine data added by API or manual entry.',
    approach: 'Started with a lean data model, iterated on tasting flows, and validated UI patterns with real entries. Built a semantic vocabulary system so notes are comparable across users.',
    leadership: 'Owned UX, IA, and the frontend. Wrote the design tokens, component patterns, and the tasting workflow. Partnered with wine-literate friends for domain checks and crafted a style that feels welcoming, not elitist.',
    impact: 'Early testers recorded tastings faster and with more detail. The shared profiles helped new drinkers articulate flavor and structure with confidence.'
