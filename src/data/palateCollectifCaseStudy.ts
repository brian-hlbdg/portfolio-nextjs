    scope: 'Designed and developed a web application that helps wine drinkers capture tasting notes, learn wine vocabulary in context, and build a personal reference library. Includes both a consumer tasting interface and an admin system for managing wine data.',
    approach: 'Combined structured data inputs with educational scaffolding to reduce intimidation while maintaining the flexibility for detailed notes. Validated interaction patterns through prototype testing with users ranging from complete beginners to certified sommeliers.',
    leadership: 'Led end-to-end product design including user research, information architecture, interaction design, visual design system, and frontend implementation. Collaborated with wine educators to ensure terminology accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness.',
    impact: 'Beta users completed their first tasting note 40% faster than with traditional apps, used more specific vocabulary in their descriptions, and reported higher confidence in articulating what they tasted. The structured approach also enabled future features like personalized recommendations based on flavor profiles.'
