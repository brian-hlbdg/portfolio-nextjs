    scope: 'Redesigned exception handling workflows within NFI\'s Relay Transportation Management System to reduce context switching, standardize resolution procedures, and improve operational response time for logistics teams.',
    approach: 'Conducted field research and event storming workshops to map real-time exception tracking, then designed a two-panel layout with a dedicated Exception Panel that keeps shipment context, exception details, and available actions within a single unified view.',
    leadership: 'Led UX initiative to reimagine how exceptions were surfaced and resolved across operations teams. Created design patterns as reusable components within the Relay Design System and collaborated with engineering to optimize performance within LiveView constraints.',
    impact: 'Reduced exception resolution time by 28%, lowered user error rates by 37%, and achieved 80% component reuse across internal modules. Transformed exception handling from an error-prone, context-switching process into a reliable experience that operational teams trust.'
